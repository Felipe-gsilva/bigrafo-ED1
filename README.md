# bigrafo-ED1
This is a opengl, glfw, glad and C made project.

The idea is to generally create a graph with nodes and edges, and then apply a bigraph test to it.

If the graph is a bigraph, the program will color the nodes in two colors, if not, the program will show where it is messed up


to run this code, you will need to be on linux and have cmake and all X11 main libs

then run

> cmake -S . -B target/

> cmake -build target/
